# Alternate BrainF

The interpreter still works with standard brainf code except you can use functions too. See "Example.abf" for how to do functions.
I will add more to this later but for now, here is some code:

```abf
{
    #
    ++++>++++<[>[>+++<-]+++<-]>>.<<
    +++++>+++<[>[>--<-]+++<-]>>.
}
!
```
