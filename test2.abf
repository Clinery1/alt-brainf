    [-]>[-]<                            This sets the ID to 0 0
    #                                   This tells the interpreter to execute the code above to get the function ID
                                            which should be in the first two cells of the mini program

    ++++>++++<[>[>+++<-]++++<-]>>.<<    Prints 0

    [-]>[-]>[-]<<                       Clears cells 0 1 2

    +++++[>++<-]>.<                     Prints a newline

    [-]>[-]<                            Every function should always clean up after itself

}                                       Close function

!                                       Call function 0 0 because cells 0 and 1 are both zero
